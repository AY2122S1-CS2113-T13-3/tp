### Architecture

![Figure_Architecture_Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the CodeHunt App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**CodeHunt components of the architecture**

**[`CodeHunt`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/game/CodeHunt.java)** is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the logger and input scanner, and calls [`GameMainMenu.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ui/main/GameMainMenu.java) to enter the game.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Utils`**](#utils-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the CodeHunt App. (Menu classes)
* [**`Game`**](#game-component): The games executors.
* [**`Player`**](#player-component): Holds the data of the CodeHunt App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

![Figure_Class_Diagram](images/WholeClass.png)

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`ui`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/ui) package

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

- main/Game main menu: Loads previous record or initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- game/Game menu: Chooses easy/difficult game level; Checks game progress/ achieved cards content.
- game/Easy menu, Difficult menu: Two game levels.
- card/Card menu:

### Game component

**API** : [`game`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/data/game) package

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Game` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

- `Game`: The parent class of game
- `GameRecord`: The list storing all the games completed by the user
- `QuizGame`: The game base on four forms of quiz
- `GuessingNumGame`: The guessing number game
- `TreasureHuntGame`: The treasure hunt game
- `TreasureHuntMap`: All the maps for the treasure hunt game

### Player component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

**Data**:
- `Player`: The database of all data for one player
- `Card`: The card with coding knowledge that a player can collect
- `CardManager`: All operations that player can do to a card list

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![Player_Class_Diagram](images/Player.png)

The `Storage` component,
* can save both **game history data** and **cards data** in `.dat` file, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* depends on some classes in the `Player` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Player`)

### Utils classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the [`utils`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/utils) package.

- [`StringParser`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/utils/StringParser.java): Parser to parser user inputs from Ui.

- [`IO`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/utils/IO.java): The input/output formatter.

- [`Errors`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/utils/Errors.java): Show different error information.

- `Messages`: Store all the constant values that are used in this programme and shown to user
  - [`Numbers`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/utils/message/Numbers.java)
  - [`Strings`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/utils/message/Strings.java)
